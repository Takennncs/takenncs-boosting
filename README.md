INSTALLATION:

1. Add to resources:
   cd resources
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/takenncs-boosting

2. Database setup (MySQL):
   CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `takenncs-boosting` (
     `charId` VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
     `xp` INT DEFAULT 0,
     `finished` INT DEFAULT 0,
     PRIMARY KEY (`charId`)
